<h1>Statistical Learning and Sparsity</h1>
<h2>Professor Robert Tibshirani, Stanford University</h2>
<p>
I will review the lasso method for high dimensional supervised learning and discuss some new developments in the area, including the Pliable Lasso, and post-selection inference for understanding the important features.
I will also describe some applications of these methods to my own collaborative work, including prediction of platelet usage at Stanford Hospital.
